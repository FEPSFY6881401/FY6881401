<h3 id="abs"> Abstract </h3>
<p>
 Nuclear fusion has long been hailed as something that will create clean, virtually unlimited source of energy (<a href="#Ref">ITER Organization, 2021</a>). Nuclear fusion is, therefore, potentially capable of completely revolutionising the world's energy landscape (<a href="#Ref">IAEA, 2020</a>). Attaining this source of energy on Earth will alter the outlook of the world as far as energy is concerned. The article introduces the world's largest fusion energy research, International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor or in short ITER hosted by France. Further, the <a href="#Ref">ITER Organization (2021)</a> infers, "The endeavour has a goal of proving to the world that it is really possible to make energy out of fusion". Major engineering issues regarding high-temperature and plasma enclosure will be tackled, and new solutions developed at ITER will be discussed (<a href="#Ref">DOE, 2020</a>). Global interest in ITER is driven by the urgent need to address both energy security and climate change (<a href="#Ref">IAEA, 2020</a>).

<h3 id="Intro">Introduction</h3>
<p id="itext">
Nuclear fusion refers to the combination of atoms into a heavier nucleus; during this process, considerable amounts of energy are produced (<a href = "#Ref">Inside ITER, 2020</a>). The very same process powering the sun and stars promises almost limitless energy (<a href="#Ref">DOE, 2020</a>). Unlike in nuclear fission where heavy atoms, such as uranium, get split. Fusion is far more capable of clean energy (<a href="#Ref">IAEA, 2020</a>). Fission reactors produce deadly radioactive waste and have always been subject to these types of catastrophic meltdowns, while the 'fusion' reactors would pose much smaller risk profiles and very limited quantities of radio-active waste. (<a href="#Ref">Inside ITER, 2020</a>). The world's largest fusion experiment, ITER or International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor is currently under construction in southern France. It is designed to show that fusion power will be a workable and reliable element in the suite of clean energy supplies for the future. (<a href="#Ref">ITER Organization, 2021</a>). This paper provides an overview of the ITER project, some of the technical challenges being faced, and possible impacts on the world's energy outlook (<a href="#Ref">DOE, 2020</a>).

<h3 id="What">What is ITER?</h3>
<p id="wtext">
ITER is made up of 35 different international collaborators some of which involves the United States, European Union, China, Russia, Japan, South Korea and India, According to ITER Organization, (<a href="#Ref">ITER Organization, 2021</a>). Their task is to build a tokomak-a variety of the fusion reactors that can confine plasma with an magnetic confinement under conditions which are most favourable for nuclear fusion. The IAEA chose, in 2020, the configuration for a tokamak because this configuration can handle the most extreme temperatures upwards of about 150 million degrees Celsius for the actual fusion to take place (<a href="#Ref">IAEA, 2020</a>).  ITER's fusion reactor will produce 500 megawatts of fusion power from a 50 megawatt input that is a tenfold energy return which will be another milestone for fusion energy. There are so many contributers to ITER as the development of ITER is essential for mankind to both progress and solve problems of energy security and alarming climate change around the world. (<a href="#Ref">DOE, 2020</a>).

<h3 id="Tech">Technical challenges</h3>
<p id="ttext">

Several specific technical problems should be overcome to attain nuclear fusion on Earth. The biggest problem is the very high temperature needed for fusion to occur which is about 150 million degrees Celsius, more than ten times higher than the temperature within the core of our Sun (<a href="#Ref">Inside ITER, 2020</a>). At such high temperatures, the isotopes of hydorgen (mainly deuterium and tritium) is turned into plasma (see figure 2), and ITER uses the latest heating methods to produce those high temperatures (see figure 1). While doing this, the plasma should be confined and aligned long for any fusion reactions to take place, and this is done through the use of several magnetic fields using giant high field electromagnets (<a href="#Ref">ITER Organization, 2021</a>). The plasma should be stable since instability will abruptly stop the fusion reaction (<a href="#Ref">Inside ITER, 2020</a>). Again, the materials in the reactor should also be able to resist these extreme conditions of heat and neutron bombardment. ITER is developing advanced materials capable of sustaining these stresses (<a href="#Ref">DOE, 2020</a>). The challenges are high, but this technological advancement at ITER has led to considerable insight into efficiency toward tackling those challenges (<a href="#Ref">IAEA, 2020</a>).

<h3 id="Global">Impact on Global Energy</h3>
<p id="gtext">

Nuclear fusion thus holds out the prospect of a complete transformation in the world's energy supply, offering essentially unlimited amounts of clean energy (<a href="#Ref">DOE, 2020</a>). It does not emit any dangerous emissions into the atmosphere, unlike combustion processes involving fossil fuels, making it especially attractive as a climate friendly source of power (<a href="#Ref">Inside ITER, 2020</a>). By comparison with other producers of clean energy, fusion also generates only extremely small quantities of long-lived radioactive waste. With a working fusion reactor, the current dependence on fossil fuels would be greatly reduced globally, thereby allowing carbon emissions to go down dramatically and possibly have an effect on climate change (<a href="#Ref">ITER Organization, 2021</a>). Energy security would also be enhanced since the fusion reactors could be located near an energy-demanding area, cutting the need for international energy trade (<a href="#Ref">DOE, 2020</a>). In the words of <a href="#Ref">ITER Organization (2021)</a>, "While fusion is not going to be commercially available until the second half of the century, improvements by ITER are an important stage in the development of fusion energy."

<h3 id="Conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p id = "ctext">
ITER is a significant step toward making nuclear fusion, as an energy source, practical and sustainable (<a href="#Ref">Inside ITER, 2020</a>). Though there are still many challenges to this pursuit, the cooperation of nations worldwide most conveys the potential and importance of fusion to revolutionise the world's production of clean energy (<a href="#Ref">DOE, 2020</a>). Iter will continue to contribute to improvements in plasma confinement, materials science, and reactor design and pave the way forward to a no emission and virtually unlimited energy source (<a href="#Ref">ITER Organization, 2021</a>). While fusion may not immediately create solutions for our present energy needs, its long-term potential has forced it to be included in the global energy conversation (<a href="#Ref">IAEA, 2020</a>).
